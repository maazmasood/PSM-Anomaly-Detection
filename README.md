# PSM-Anomaly-Detection
This project introduces GCT-GAN, a hybrid deep learning framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series. It combines Transformer Autoencoder reconstruction, GAN adversarial regularization, contrastive loss for representation learning, and geometric masking for robust data augmentation.
